- why softmax instead of some other normalization?
  - why not xi / sum(xi)?
- how much do rnns learn. can they learn the sequence identity function. how much can they recall
  - add some details 
- why do you need non linearities? aren't the multiple layers enough to learn complex functions?
- other than padding how do you deal with variable length inputs?
  - rnn
  - convolutions
- how paralelizable are current dl training algos? 50?
- why gradient descent vs randomized search?
